# Book_Directory
Book Directory is an interactive book list that allows users to store books information in list organized using different identifiers which are:

Name of the book

Name of the Author

Year Published

ISBN of the book

The graphical interface allows the user to interact with the data without understanding how the code behind the GUI works. The interface includes 4 entry boxes indicated by labels where user can input their set of 4 identifiers mentioned above to add create a completed book feature into the directory for later use.

The backend of this project utilized Tkinter which is a GUI library created for python that gave this program a interactive look with buttons and entry boxes.
The data entered in entry boxes, retrival of book, and commands for each button was intergrated with SQLite3 to store data and interact with the data based on the buttons pressed.
